Release 2.0

	Rewrote into a better-encapsulated library after not touching this
	code for many years.  The monitor window is gone, as is the XMMS
	plugin (seeing as how XMMS has completely changed since the last
	time I did anything with this).

Release 1.5.2

	Brian L. actually tried using the -t parameter.  What a maroon.

2004-03-29

Release 1.5.1

	Saravana Krishna determined that XMMS wasn't calling myInit.  Fixed.

2004-02-05

	Added byte-swapping to commandline client (-x)

2003-07-04

Release 1.5
	
	Trying to work out why the esd stuff hangs on my system...
	
	Made the commandline filter respect config.h's ANTICLIP value

	Courtney Bane found a really stupid bug in compress.c, and it
	surprises me that I had never run into it before.
	
2003-07-03

	Andrzej Szombierski (qq at kuku.eu.org) added in EsounD plugin
	functionality.  Thanks!

2003-05-31

Release 1.4

	Added X-less option

2003-04-04

Release 1.3

	When you want something done right, you have to do it yourself...
	There's now commandline configuration for AudioCompress.

2003-04-03

	CompressCfg() now actually detects whether it's possible to show
	the monitor when it's asked to.

	Also, Levi Ramsey has promised to send me a patch to configure the
	commandline AudioCompress tool at runtime.  I could have coded it
	myself, but I'm too lazy to write code that I'm not actually going
	to use. :D
	
2003-03-07

Release 1.2.1 again

	Oops.  There was a silly C99-ism in compress.c.  I'm surprised
	nobody ran into it sooner...

2003-03-06

Release 1.2.1

	Oops.  Wasn't actually checking to see if things were allocated first
	before freeing them in CompressFree().  Thanks to Miguel Provencio for
	noticing this.

2003-02-23

Release 1.2

	Changed name to AudioCompress
	
	Separated the compressor code from the XMMS-specific
	functionality, to make it easier to make compressor plugins for
	lots of different things

	Made simple commandline "plugin" for piping
	
2002-08-22

	Changed gain indicator in monitor window to be 1..gainmax, rather
	than 0..4

2002-07-31

Release 1.1

	I rewrote the configfile handling, which was causing some very
	nasty bugs (such as XMMS no longer saving its own preferences).

	I also rewrote large parts of the README, and removed GAINSHIFT
	from the configuration dialog, since there's really no reason for
	it to be there.
	
2002-07-15

	Javier split off the preferences into a separate file and fixed a
	few other minor bugs (like it not saving the monitor window pref)

2002-07-09

Release 1.0
	
	There is now runtime configuration, thanks to Javier Conde Rueda.
	MANY thanks!  (This is what was keeping me from making it a 1.0
	version.)

2002-06-24  fluffy <fluffy@beesbuzz.biz>

Release 0.4
	
	Enforces minimum amplification of 1.0 (to make lower TARGET values
	sensical)

	Added OSX build

	Changed default settings (again), this time for better
	preservation of dynamic range
	
2002-04-21  fluffy <fluffy@beesbuzz.biz>

Release 0.3
	
	More documentation improvements

	Monitor has a better clip indicator and also shows where the
	current "global peak" will be amplified to

	Better (IMO) default configuration
	
2002-04-18  fluffy <fluffy@beesbuzz.biz>

Release 0.2
	
	Documentation improvements (actually explaining what the different
	configuration variables do, for example)

	Build improvements (uses xmms-config to provide proper -I for xmms
	headers, as well as an install target for system-wide plugin
	installation)

	More ramping tweaks, as well as target audio level

	Monitor now shows amplification level and when clipping happens
	
Release 0.1
	
	Initial version
