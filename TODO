Proper support for non-ELF/gcc systems (using libtool or autoconf)

Rewrite the xmms preferences stuff (it's really nasty right now, being

Make it possible to close the monitor window from the WM

Extend logic beyond 16-bit native-endian signed

aRts plugin (should be easy)

though, like actually keeping track of how many channels there are...

Figure out why on some sound hardware, ESD filters hang up (even
though it's not technically a problem with AudioCompress)
